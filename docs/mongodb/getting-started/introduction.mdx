## Peek inside Mongez MongoDB

Here is a simple example of defining a User model:
    
```ts title="src/models/user.ts"
import { Model } from '@mongez/mongodb';

export class User extends Model {
    /**
     * The collection name
     * Must be defined explicitly.
    */
    public static collection = 'users';
}
```

And here is how to use it:

```ts title="src/controllers/users.ts"

import { User } from 'src/models/user';

export async function createUser() {
    const user = await User.create({
        name: "Hasan Zohdy",
        email: "hassanzohdy@gmail.com",
    });

    console.log(user.data);
}
```

Outputs something similar to:

```json
{
    "id": 1231412,
    "_id": "fagtrw43qwedasjoijwq",
    "name": "Hasan Zohdy",
    "email": "hassanzohdy@gmail.com",
    createdAt: "2023-06-01 00:00:00",
    updatedAt: "2023-06-01 00:00:00",
}
```
