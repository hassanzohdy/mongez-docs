# Introduction

Auth is a very important part of any web application, `Warlock` embraces API that provides a simple and easy to use API to manage users and authentication.

## Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, so when a user logs in, we need to verify that this user is who he claims to be.

## JWT

As `warlock` embraces API, it uses `JWT` as the main authentication method, so when a user logs in, a `JWT` token will be generated and sent to the user, and the user will send this token with every request to the server.

## How it works

First off, we need to generate a JWT (JSON Web Token) for the user, this token will be sent to the user and the user will send it with every request to the server.

When the user sends a request to the server, the server will check if the token is valid, if it's valid, then the user is authenticated, if not, then the user is not authenticated.

## User Management

We can generate a JWT for logged in user, but also could be generated for [Guests](./guests).

`Warlock` deals with guests as normal users, but with a special role, so we can use the same API for both guests and logged in users.

So the cycle with Guest users is as follows:

1. For first time visit, `Guest` token is generated and sent to the user using for example `/login/guests` request.
2. Any public request will require at a `JWT`, either for guests or actual logged in users.
3. When the user logs in, a `JWT` is generated for him and sent to him.
4. The user will send this token with every request to the server.
5. When user decides to logout, the token will be deleted from the database by sending a request to `/logout` endpoint.
