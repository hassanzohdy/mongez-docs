# Upload Model

`Warlock` is shipped with `Upload` model to store the uploaded files in the database.

When a [file](./uploading-files.mdx) is uploaded, it will be stored in the database using the `Upload` model.

## Stored data

The following schema is stored inside the uploads collection for each uploaded file:

```json
{
  "hash": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "size": "number",
  "extension": "string",
  "path": "string",
  "directory": "string",
  "mimeType": "string"
}
```

If the uploaded file is an image, then `width` and `height` will be stored as well.

The `size` is stored in bytes.

The `file name` will be stored as-is from the upload request, this is has nothing related to whether if the uploaded file is stored with its name or randomly.

## Upload output

When the upload model is sent to the response, the `UploadOutput` will return the following data:

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "hash": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "size": "number",
  "extension": "string",
  "url": "string",
  "mimeType": "string",
  "width": "number",
  "height": "number"
}
```

The id and hash are both the same, so you can use either of them.

The `url` is the full URL to the uploaded file, it's generated by passing the file `path` the `uploadsUrl` function.

The `width` and `height` are only returned if the uploaded file is an image.
