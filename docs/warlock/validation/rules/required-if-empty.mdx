# Required If Empty

The input must be present and not empty if another input is empty.

The validation rule **does not require a value** to run.

## Example

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/register.ts"
// ...
createAccount.validation = {
  rules: {
    email: ["requiredIfEmpty:phoneNumber", "email"],
    phoneNumber: ["requiredIfEmpty:email"],
  },
};
```

In the above case, both inputs are optional, however, if one of them has a value, the other one must be empty, if both are empty then the email input will be required.
