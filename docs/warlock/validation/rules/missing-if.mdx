# Missing If

The input must be not present or empty if another input is equal to the given value.

> The validation rule **does not require a value** to run against the input value.

The `min` rule works against floats and integers.

## Example

```ts title="src/app/products/controllers/create-product.ts"
// ...
createProduct.validation = {
  rules: {
    category: ["missingIf:type,variation"],
  },
};
```

The previous validation works in a good use case, where you have an online store with multiple type of products, in this use case, the variation (child product) should not have a category because the parent product already has a category.
