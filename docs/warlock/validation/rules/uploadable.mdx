# Uploadable

Check if the input value is a hash of [Uploadable](./../../upload/upload-model).

> This rule is a database dependent rule. It requires a database connection to run against the input value.

> The validation rule **requires a value** to run against the input value.

Basically it works by uploading the files in a separate request then attach the upload hash to certain model, i.e user avatar, post image etc.

## Example

```ts title="src/app/posts/controllers/create-post.ts"
// ...
createPost.validation = {
  rules: {
    title: ["required", "stringify"],
    image: ["required", "uploadable"],
  },
};
```

The rule will fetch the `uploads collection` for the given hash and check if the hash exists, if not exists, the validation will fail.
