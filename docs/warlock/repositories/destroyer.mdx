# Repository Destroyer

When it comes to deleting records, repository manager provides two ways of deleting records.

## Delete by ID

The first way is to delete a record by its ID. The `RepositoryManager` class provides a `delete` method that you can use to delete a record by its ID.

```ts title="src/app/main.ts"
import { usersRepository } from "app/users/repositories/users-repository";

usersRepository.delete(1);
```

The delete method accepts an integer (as id) or an instance of model as well:

```ts title="src/app/main.ts"
import { usersRepository } from "app/users/repositories/users-repository";

const user = await usersRepository.find(1);

usersRepository.delete(user);
```

## Delete multiple documents

To delete multiple documents using the repository, you can use the `deleteMany` method, it accepts a filter object, if not passed, all documents will be DELETED!

```ts title="src/app/main.ts"
import { usersRepository } from "app/users/repositories/users-repository";

usersRepository.deleteMany({
  age: 18,
});
```
