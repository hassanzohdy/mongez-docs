# Fetching Documents

Fetching documents using Mongez Aggregate class.

## Introduction

As we saw, `Aggregate` is a pipeline that hold multiple stages, we saw how to build the pipeline, now let's see how to fetch the documents.

## Using get method

This is the most common method to fetch documents, it will return an array of documents.

Let's see an example

```ts
import { Aggregate } from "@mongez/mongodb";

const users = await new Aggregate("users").where("id", ">", 1500).get();
```

This will return list of documents for the users collection.

If we want to map the date before final return, we can pass a callback to the `get` method.

```ts
const users = await new Aggregate("users").get((user) => {
  user.age = new Date().getFullYear() - user.birthYear;
  return user;
});
```

## Get first document

To fetch only first matched document, we can use `first` method.

```ts
const user = await new Aggregate("users").where("id", 1500).first();
```

If no results found, `null` will be returned.

## Get last document

Return last matched document.

```ts
const user = await new Aggregate("users").where("id", 1500).last();
```

## Pagination

Another powerful feature of `Aggregate` is pagination, we can use `paginate` method to paginate the results.

```ts
const results = await new Aggregate("users").paginate(1, 10);
```

The first argument is the page number, and the second argument is the limit.

The results contains an object with the following structure:

```ts
export type PaginationInfo = {
  /**
   * Limit of the query
   */
  limit: number;
  /**
   * Results of the query
   */
  result: number;
  /**
   * Current page of the query
   */
  page: number;
  /**
   * total results of the query
   */
  total: number;
  /**
   * total pages of the query
   */
  pages: number;
};
/**
 * The result of the paginate query
 */
export type PaginationListing<T> = {
  /**
   * Results of the query
   */
  documents: T[];
  /**
   * The pagination results
   */
  paginationInfo: PaginationInfo;
};
```

So basically, it returns `documents` and `paginationInfo` object, the `documents` is an array of documents, and the `paginationInfo` contains the pagination information.

## Count documents

To count the number of documents, we can use `count` method.

```ts
const count = await new Aggregate("users").count();
```

## Explain

Sometimes we need to know how the query is executed, we can use `explain` method to get the execution plan of the query.

```ts
const results = await new Aggregate("users").explain();
```
