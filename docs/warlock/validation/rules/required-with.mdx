# Required With

The input under validation must be present and not empty only if any of the other specified fields are present.

The validation rule **does not require a value** to run.

## Example

```ts title="src/app/posts/controllers/create-post.ts"
// ...
createPost.validation = {
  rules: {
    title: ["required"],
    "series.name": ["string"],
    "series.order": ["requiredWith:series.name"],
  },
};
```

It will fail ony and only if `series.name` is present and `series.order` is empty.
