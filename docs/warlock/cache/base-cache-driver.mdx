# Base Cache Driver

The base cache driver is an abstract class that all built-in cache drivers are derived from. It defines the common methods and properties to reduce the amount of code duplication.

## Required properties

The Base Cache Driver implements [CacheDriverInterface](./cache-driver-interface) and requires only one property to be defined the `name` property, this property is used to identify the cache driver name that will be used for logging purposes.

## Implemented methods

It implements the following methods:

- `setOptions`: This method is used to set the cache driver options.
- `parseKey`: This method is used to parse the cache key.
- `log`: This method is used to log messages to the logger.

Our base driver will call [Prase Cache Key utility](./utils#parse-cache-key) when implementing the `parseKey` method.
