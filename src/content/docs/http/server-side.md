  Using `@mongez/http` on a **server** — Next.js App Router / server components / SSR, Node services, workers, and any multi-tenant process. Covers the browser-vs-server defaults for GET deduplication (`dedupe`, per-request `dedupeKey`), the identity-aware key required by the response `cache` (`cacheKey`, `generateKey`), forwarding framework fetch options with `fetchInit` (Next.js `next: { revalidate, tags }` + `revalidateTag`), and why `setCurrentHttp` is unsafe per-request on a server. Read this before using the package outside a browser.

A browser runs **one user per instance**. A server runs **many users per process**. Two
features of this package are optimisations that quietly assume the first: GET
deduplication and the response cache. Both key on **URL + params** — never on
credentials — so on a server they could hand one user's response to another.

Since **v3.4.0** the package defaults to the safe behaviour off the browser and refuses
to guess at identity. This skill is the whole story.

## The environment check

Everything below keys off one thing: `typeof window === "undefined"`. Browser-like →
deduplication and the default cache key are allowed. Anything else — Next.js server
components, route handlers, SSR, Node, Bun, Deno, workers — is treated as multi-user.

## GET deduplication

In a browser, concurrent GETs to the same URL share one underlying fetch. That is pure
win: same user, same request, half the traffic.

On a server it is a **cross-user data leak**. Two concurrent `GET /me` calls carrying
different bearer tokens would share one fetch, and both callers would receive the first
caller's response. It is timing-dependent, so it never shows up in testing.

```ts
// Default behaviour — no configuration needed
dedupe: typeof window !== 'undefined'   // true in a browser, false on a server
```

| Setting | Where | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `dedupe: false` | `HttpConfig` | Off for the whole instance |
| `dedupe: false` | `RequestOptions` | Off for one call |
| `dedupe: true` | either | On — but server-side each GET then **needs** a `dedupeKey` |

### Opting in on a server

If you genuinely want deduplication server-side — a request-scoped instance fanning out
to the same endpoint several times — you must say what makes two callers different:

```ts
const http = new Http({ baseURL, dedupe: true, auth: () => session.token });

// ✅ The key carries identity, so two users never share a fetch.
await http.get('/me', { dedupeKey: `me:${session.userId}` });

// ❌ Throws: dedupe is on outside a browser with no identity-aware key.
await http.get('/me');
```

The library **will not guess** which header carries identity. It could be
`Authorization`, a session cookie, `X-Tenant-Id`, or a signed header — a guess would
silently miss cases while *looking* safe, which is worse than failing loudly. You know
your app; you supply the key.

> `HttpConfig.dedupeKey(url, params)` does **not** satisfy this. It only ever receives the
> URL and params — never headers or options — so it cannot express "same URL, different
> user". It stays a browser-side tuning knob.

## Response caching

The cache is **opt-in**: with no `driver` configured it never runs at all. But when you
do enable it on a server, its default key has the same blind spot — so an identity-aware
key is required:

```ts
// ✅ Per-request key
await http.get('/me', { cacheKey: `me:${session.userId}` });

// ✅ Or a generator that closes over the caller (request-scoped instance)
const http = new Http({
  baseURL,
  cache: {
    driver,
    generateKey: (url, params) =>
      `u:${session.userId}:${url}:${JSON.stringify(params ?? {})}`,
  },
});

// ❌ Throws: cache enabled outside a browser with the default URL+params key.
const http = new Http({ baseURL, cache: { driver } });
await http.get('/me');
```

**Prefer not to use it server-side at all.** The built-in cache is designed as a
client-side feature. On a server, reach for the framework's own cache (below) or a store
you key per request.

## Next.js — `fetchInit`

The library builds its `RequestInit` from a fixed set of keys, so anything it doesn't
model would be dropped. `fetchInit` forwards extra keys verbatim to the underlying
`fetch()`. It's framework-neutral — use it for Next.js, or for Deno/Bun/Cloudflare keys.

This matters most for **cache tags**, which attach per-fetch. Without forwarding,
`revalidateTag()` after a mutation silently invalidates nothing — and because caching is
largely disabled in development, it looks correct locally and fails in production.

```ts
// Instance-wide default
const http = new Http({ baseURL, fetchInit: { next: { revalidate: 60 } } });

// Per-request — merged over the config one
const { data } = await http.get<Post[]>('/posts', {
  fetchInit: { next: { tags: ['posts'] } },
});

// …then, after a mutation:
import { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache';
revalidateTag('posts');
```

`no-store` / `force-cache` already have a first-class option — use `fetchCache`:

```ts
await http.get('/live', { fetchCache: 'no-store' });
```

### What `fetchInit` cannot override

`fetchInit` is spread **first**; the fields the library manages are written last.

| Field | Overridable? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `method`, `headers`, `body` | ❌ never | Would bypass interceptors and auth |
| `signal` | ❌ never | Would break `.cancel()` and the timeout controller |
| `credentials`, `mode`, `keepalive`, `redirect`, `cache` | Only when unset | A configured value wins; an unset one leaves yours alone |
| anything else (`next`, runtime flags) | ✅ always | That's the point |

It applies to **both** fetch paths — regular requests and `stream()` — so streamed
responses are forwarded too. (`keepalive` is the one exception: it never applies to a
stream, since it caps the body at 64 KB.)

## `setCurrentHttp` is global state

`setCurrentHttp` writes a module-level singleton. In a browser that's a convenience; in a
server process it's shared mutable state across concurrent requests. Calling it **per
request** — to attach the current user's token — lets one request overwrite the instance
another is mid-way through using.

```ts
// ❌ Server — request A can end up sending request B's token
export async function handler(req) {
  setCurrentHttp(new Http({ baseURL, auth: tokenFrom(req) }));
  return ordersResource.list();
}

// ✅ Server — build a request-scoped instance and pass it explicitly
export async function handler(req) {
  const http = new Http({ baseURL, auth: tokenFrom(req) });
  return new OrdersResource().useHttp(http).list();
}
```

`setCurrentHttp` at bootstrap with an instance carrying **no per-user state** is fine
anywhere.

## Recommended server setup

```ts
// One request-scoped instance, no shared caches, framework cache for revalidation.
import { Http } from '@mongez/http';

export function httpFor(session: Session) {
  return new Http({
    baseURL: process.env.API_URL!,
    auth: () => `Bearer ${session.token}`,
    // dedupe defaults to false here — nothing to switch off.
    // No `cache` — let Next's data cache handle it:
    fetchInit: { next: { revalidate: 60 } },
  });
}
```

## Migrating from ≤ 3.3.x

If your server-side code relied on the old behaviour, the changes are:

- **GET deduplication no longer happens on a server.** You may see more outbound
  requests. That is the fix — they were previously sharing responses across callers.
  To keep it, opt in with `dedupe: true` **and** a per-request `dedupeKey`.
- **An enabled cache now throws on a server** unless you pass `cacheKey` or
  `cache.generateKey`. The error message names the fix.
- Browser behaviour is **unchanged** — same defaults, same keys.
