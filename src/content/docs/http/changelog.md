Server-side safety and Next.js compatibility. **Browser behaviour is unchanged** — every
default, key and option behaves exactly as before. Everything here applies off the browser
(`typeof window === "undefined"`): Next.js server components and SSR, Node services,
workers, and any multi-tenant process.

### Fixed

- **🔴 GET deduplication could serve one user's response to another on a server.** The
  dedup key is built from URL + query params before the outgoing request exists, so it
  never included `Authorization`, cookies or any per-request header. Two concurrent
  `GET /me` calls carrying **different** bearer tokens shared one in-flight fetch and both
  callers received the first caller's response — silent, timing-dependent, and invisible in
  normal testing. Deduplication now **defaults to off outside a browser**, where it was
  only ever an optimisation for a single user. `config.dedupeKey` was not an escape hatch
  for this: its `(url, params)` signature never receives headers, so a credential-aware key
  could not be written from outside the package. **Server-side users should upgrade.**

### Added

- **`fetchInit` on `HttpConfig` and `RequestOptions`** — extra `RequestInit` fields
  forwarded verbatim to the underlying `fetch()`. The init object was built from a fixed
  set of keys, so anything the library didn't model was silently dropped — including
  Next.js' `next: { revalidate, tags }`. Tags attach *per fetch*, so `revalidateTag()`
  after a mutation invalidated nothing; it looked correct in development (where caching is
  largely disabled) and failed in production. Framework-neutral: also covers Deno/Bun/
  Cloudflare keys and whatever comes next.

  ```ts
  const http = new Http({ baseURL, fetchInit: { next: { revalidate: 60 } } });
  await http.get('/posts', { fetchInit: { next: { tags: ['posts'] } } });
  ```

  Caller-supplied keys are merged **first** so the library's own fields win: `method`,
  `headers`, `body` and `signal` can never be overridden (that would bypass interceptors
  and auth, or break cancellation and the timeout controller), and `credentials` / `mode` /
  `keepalive` / `redirect` / `fetchCache` win whenever they are actually configured.
  Applied at **both** fetch call sites — regular requests and `stream()`.
- **`dedupe?: boolean` on `HttpConfig` and `RequestOptions`** — turn GET deduplication on
  or off per instance or per call. Defaults to `true` in a browser, `false` elsewhere.
- **`dedupeKey?: string` on `RequestOptions`** — an explicit, identity-aware dedup key,
  mirroring the existing `cacheKey`. Required for every deduplicated GET when `dedupe` is
  enabled outside a browser; takes precedence over `HttpConfig.dedupeKey`.

### Changed

- **An enabled response cache now requires an identity-aware key outside a browser.** The
  cache is opt-in and stays completely inert when no driver is configured — but once
  enabled on a server its default URL + params key had the same blind spot as the dedup
  key. It now throws unless you pass a per-request `cacheKey` or a `cache.generateKey`,
  naming the fix in the message. The built-in cache remains a **client-side** feature; on a
  server prefer the framework's cache (Next.js' data cache via `fetchInit`) or a store you
  key per request.
- **Opting into deduplication outside a browser throws without a per-request `dedupeKey`.**
  The library deliberately does not hash a guessed list of credential headers into the
  default key — it cannot know whether identity lives in `Authorization`, a session cookie
  or a custom `X-Tenant-Id`, and a guess would miss cases while *looking* safe. Failing
  loudly is the safer default.

### Docs

- **New `server-side` skill** covering the browser-vs-server split end to end: dedup and
  cache defaults, identity-aware keys, `fetchInit` with a full `revalidateTag` example, and
  why `setCurrentHttp` is module-level global state that must not be called per request on
  a server. `overview`, `http-client`, `caching` and `recipes` updated to match and to
  cross-link it; `setCurrentHttp` carries the same warning in its JSDoc.

<summary><span class="cl-version">[3.3.8]</span> <span class="cl-date">2026-06-04</span> <span class="cl-counts">Changed (2)</span></summary>

### Changed

- **Skills now state the response-typing rule explicitly.** The `http-client` skill gained a *"Type the response — always pass a generic"* section: every verb is `get<T = unknown>(…)`, so omitting the type leaves `data` as `unknown` and `data.first_name` won't compile — always call `http.get<User>(…)` and narrow on `error` first. Mirrored into `llms-full.txt`.
- **Sharper skill triggers.** The `overview` and `http-client` skill descriptions now fire on *making HTTP/API requests*, *replacing axios/fetch*, and *typing a response*, so an agent loads them instead of reverse-engineering usage from source. No code/API changes.

<summary><span class="cl-version">[3.3.7]</span> <span class="cl-counts">Changed (1)</span></summary>

### Changed

- **`llms.txt` blurb now uses the `>` blockquote convention** to match every other `@mongez/*` package, so the ecosystem index extracts it consistently. No code/API changes.

<details class="changelog-version">
<summary><span class="cl-version">[3.3.6]</span> <span class="cl-counts">Added (1)</span></summary>

### Added

- This changelog. No code changes — the package remains the fetch-based HTTP client with the `{ data, error }` result type, per-request cancellation, GET deduplication + retry, response caching, before/after interceptors, lifecycle events, and the `Resource` CRUD helper.

> Version history prior to 3.3.6 is available via the git tags and GitHub releases on [hassanzohdy/mongez-http](https://github.com/hassanzohdy/mongez-http). Future releases will be documented here.
