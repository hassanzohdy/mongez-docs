# Object

Check if the input value is an object.

The validation rule **requires a value** to run.

:::tip
This works in both json and form data requests as warlock automatically parses the request body.

## Example

```ts title="src/app/products/controllers/create-product.ts"
// ...
createProduct.validation = {
  rules: {
    details: ["required", "object"],
  },
};
```
