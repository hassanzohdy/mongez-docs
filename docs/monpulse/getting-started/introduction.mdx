## Peek inside Monpulse

Here is a simple example of defining a User model:

```ts title="src/models/user.ts"
import { Model } from "@mongez/monpulse";

export class User extends Model {
  /**
   * The collection name
   * Must be defined explicitly.
   */
  public static collection = "users";
}
```

A quick example of creating a user:

```ts title="src/controllers/users.ts"
import { User } from "src/models/user";

export async function createUser() {
  const user = await User.create({
    name: "Hasan Zohdy",
    email: "hassanzohdy@gmail.com",
  });

  console.log(user.data);
}
```

Outputs something similar to:

```json
{
  "id": 1231412,
  "_id": "fagtrw43qwedasjoijwq",
  "name": "Hasan Zohdy",
  "email": "hassanzohdy@gmail.com",
  "createdAt": "2023-06-01 00:00:00",
  "updatedAt": "2023-06-01 00:00:00"
}
```
